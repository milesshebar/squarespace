# piet
interactive webpage that enables users to change colors of tiles on a website in real time

## Setup for development
- Requrires [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) to run locally
- Clone the repository
- Install dependencies with `npm install`
- Run `npm run start` to turn on watchers for HTML and CSS
 - This script watches for changes to the `_sass/main.scss` and `_javascript/main.js` and transpiles them to `css/main.css` and `lib/main.js` respectively. 
- Run live however you prefer. I recommend using [live-server](https://github.com/tapio/live-server).
